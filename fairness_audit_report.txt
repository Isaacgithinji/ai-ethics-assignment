COMPAS RECIDIVISM ALGORITHM BIAS AUDIT
Generated: 2025-12-01 11:08:27

DATASET OVERVIEW:
- Total Records Analyzed: 5,278
- African-American: 3,175 (60.2%)
- Caucasian: 2,103 (39.8%)

KEY FINDINGS:

1. ALGORITHMIC BIAS DETECTED:
   - African-Americans are labeled high risk at 57.6%
   - Caucasians are labeled high risk at 33.1%
   - Disparity: 24.5% points

2. FALSE POSITIVE RATE DISPARITY:
   - African-Americans: 42.3% (incorrectly labeled high risk)
   - Caucasians: 22.0% (incorrectly labeled high risk)
   - ⚠️ African-Americans are 1.92x more likely
      to be incorrectly labeled high risk

3. FAIRNESS METRICS:
   - Disparate Impact Ratio: 0.7828
     (Fair range: 0.8 - 1.2; Current value indicates bias)
   - Statistical Parity Difference: -0.1323
     (Optimal: 0.0; Current value shows unfairness)

REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. DATA REBALANCING:
   - Collect more diverse training data
   - Ensure equal representation across racial groups
   - Address historical biases in arrest/conviction data

2. ALGORITHMIC INTERVENTION:
   - Apply fairness-aware preprocessing (e.g., reweighing)
   - Use adversarial debiasing techniques
   - Implement post-processing calibration

3. POLICY CHANGES:
   - Require human review for all high-risk classifications
   - Establish regular bias audits (quarterly)
   - Create appeals process for disputed risk scores
   - Prohibit use as sole decision-making factor

4. MONITORING:
   - Track false positive rates by demographic group monthly
   - Set fairness thresholds (Disparate Impact > 0.8)
   - Conduct intersectional analysis (race + gender + age)

CONCLUSION:
The COMPAS algorithm exhibits significant racial bias, disproportionately harming
African-American defendants. Immediate intervention required before continued deployment.
